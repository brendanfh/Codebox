[X] Word problems ------------------
	X Use test case 1 for answer
	X input doesn't matter
	* Different UI for answering
		X Don't use submission page
		X Show result on problem page
		* This could be better and not require a reload

[X] Problem preview
	X Add button on problem edit page
	X Add page that simply renders the problem in the same way as the existing problem description

[ ] Multiple active competitions at a time
	* When users visit root of site, display list of active competitions
	* Users join each competition independently
	* Shouldn't be much overhead, just removing all instances where searching for currently active competition

[ ] Add shortcuts around the site
	* Problem description -> Problem submissions
	* Job result -> Problem description

[ ] LEADERBOARD SCROLLING POSITION STUFF
	* Send new position to updater
	* Push place updates to clients
	* Clients position the places
	* When all updates are done, the clients refresh the leaderboard
